# Mydis Webpage Project
 This webpage is designed with reusable components and most of them are customizable and render from given data

# Why is this repository public?
This is my last commit before I start working on the backend, the final result will be uploaded to a functional webpage.

After I finish the backend communication (Wich I am actually working) I'll keep improving the components
